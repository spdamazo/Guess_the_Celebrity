Instructions
Assignment 02: 
Design and Implement a Guess the Celebrity or similar interface.

Route One:
Your group is to work on developing a simple Guessing Game App.

Your App must include:
1) A main menu screen.
1.1) The main menu should include three options, one to go for starting the Guessing activity, one for Settings, and one for About.
2) The Screens.
2.1) The Guessing Game. 
2.1.1) The guessing game is the main part of your assignment, where you'll present your user with an image and the user will guess the name/meaning of it. Some suggestions include utilizing Celebrities such as Actors or Sportsman, Pokemon, Political Figures or any other similar concept. Pick something you like, make a guessing game based on it!
2.1.2) The game should run for at least five levels, allowing the user to answer at least five different guesses from a pool of at least ten options.
2.1.3) Users should be able to go back and forth between the guesses, but should only be able to score them once. You need to indicate to the user if they got it wrong or right by giving a visual cue on the app (which should show on previous questions, the selected and the correct answer).
2.2) The Settings Screen. 
2.1.1) The settings screen should allow the user to reset the current run of the game (persistency is only required while running the application), change the number of guesses they want to make and change between at least two different themes.
2.3) The About Screen. 
2.1.1) A simple screen including information on you, the team. Include the date of the project and the participants, along with a simple description of your app such as any About section on applications and websites.
3) Your application must adhere to the standards set in class regarding consistent naming conventions and Mobile Development Practices (use of string resources, etc.)
